    <h2>Biriyani</h2>
    <p>Biryani is all about rice; therefore, cooking the rice right is imperative. Biryani calls for 70 percent cooked rice, which means itâ€™s al dente. At this stage, the rice grains are slightly firm (not tough) when pressed in between the fingers. However, care should be taken to avoid turning them mushy with overcooking.</p>
